# git-tutorial
This is my final project for my CS 187 course. Here I had to apply the knowledge and HTML/CSS techniques we learned during class to design a webpage about our personal development throughout the course.
My code was inspired from the lessons on "https://www.w3schools.com/" and the tips provided in a HTML/CSS recap pdf, although I altered most elements of the code I used to fit the theme of the webpage.
